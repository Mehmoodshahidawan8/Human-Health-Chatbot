# **Human Health Chatbot 🤖💙 (C++)**  

## **Project Description**  
The **Human Health Chatbot** is a simple **C++ console-based chatbot** designed to provide **basic health advice**, answer **common medical queries**, and offer **general wellness tips**. It helps users by providing information on **symptoms, healthy habits, and first aid guidance** in an interactive manner.

✅ **Simple Console-Based Interaction** – Easy-to-use and lightweight  
✅ **No Internet Required** – Runs completely offline  

## **How It Works**  
1. **User enters a health-related query** (e.g., "What are the symptoms of fever?")  
2. **Chatbot processes the input** and provides relevant health information  
3. **Suggests general remedies** or when to consult a doctor  
4. **Encourages healthy habits** with daily wellness tips  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **C++** (Core logic & chatbot engine)
